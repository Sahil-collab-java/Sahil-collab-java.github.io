# 🌐 Network Services

### 🔧 **1. Common Network Services**

- Services are provided using a **client-server model**.
- A **client device** (e.g., web browser) requests resources from a **server** (e.g., web server).
- Devices can be on different networks (e.g., accessing a website over the Internet).

### 📡 **2. Network Protocols**

Protocols define how devices communicate. The most important ones are part of the **TCP/IP suite**:

- **TCP:** Reliable data delivery.
- **IP:** Routes packets across networks.
- Together, they allow devices to identify each other and send data correctly.

### 🌍 **3. Web Services**

- **HTTP:** Used for standard webpage transfers.
- **HTTPS:** Adds encryption using **SSL** or **TLS** for secure browsing.
- **Web server software:** Apache, Nginx (open-source); IIS (Windows-based).

---

### 📧 **4. Email Services**

- **SMTP:** Sends email from sender to mail servers.
- **POP3:** Downloads email and deletes it from server.
- **IMAP4:** Keeps email on server for multi-device access.
- Encryption via **SSL/TLS** ensures secure transmission.

### 🌐 **5. DNS (Domain Name System)**

- Resolves domain names (like [www.example.com]) into IP addresses.
- Critical for accessing websites and services by name instead of numeric IPs.

---

### 🗃️ **6. Database Services**

- **DBMS** allows data storage, access, and management.
- **SQL** is the primary language used for interacting with databases.
- Examples: Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL (open source).

---

### 🔁 **7. File Transfer Services**

- **FTP:** Used for transferring files but lacks security.
- **FTPS:** FTP secured with SSL/TLS.
- **SFTP:** Secure transfer based on **SSH**, preferred for modern use.

---

### 🖥️ **8. Remote Access Services**

- Allow control of remote computers.
- **Telnet:** Insecure and outdated.
- **SSH:** Secure, encrypted command-line access.
- **RDP:** Graphical remote access on Windows.
